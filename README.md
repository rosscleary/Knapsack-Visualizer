# Knapsack Visualizer

This is a web application built with HTML, Javascript and CSS. 
It allows the user to input a list of items, each having a name, type, price, and value. It then allows the user to input a budget, and it runs the dynamic programming algorithm to determine the maximum value for each state. Each state is defined as the maximum value that can be obtained by picking one item of each type up to each type in the sorted list with each amount of money from zero to the overall budget. In addition to showing the dynamic programming table, it also shows the optimal items to select from the list.
